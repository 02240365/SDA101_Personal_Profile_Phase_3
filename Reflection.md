# Reflection on Personal Profile Webpage Project Phase 3

## Main Concepts Applied

**HTML Structure:** I used HTML to structure the content of the page. The `<header>` and `<nav>` tags were used for the navigation menu, while the `<section>` tags organized different sections such as About, Services, Portfolio, and Contact. This helped me organize the content logically and made the webpage more accessible and SEO-friendly.

**CSS for Styling:** I utilized an external CSS file (personalp.css) to style the page. This allowed for a clean separation of structure and presentation, enhancing the maintainability of the webpage. Concepts such as layout design (using grid and flexbox), typography, and spacing were key to making the webpage visually appealing and user-friendly.

**Responsive Design:** I focused on making the webpage responsive, ensuring it adjusts to different screen sizes. This involved setting the viewport meta tag in HTML and utilizing flexible units like percentages and vw (viewport width) in CSS. This practice is essential for ensuring that the webpage is usable on both mobile and desktop devices.

**User Experience (UX):** I emphasized creating a positive user experience by focusing on clear navigation, a clean layout, and readable typography. Interactive elements like buttons in the portfolio section and the contact form were styled to improve usability and user engagement.



## New Skills and Knowledge Gained

**HTML5 Elements:** I became more familiar with modern HTML5 elements like `<section>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, and `<footer>`. These elements helped structure the page in a semantically correct way, improving both accessibility and SEO.

**Creating Interactive Forms:** The contact form was a new challenge, and I learned how to create a functional form that can collect user input. Even though the form action is linked to contact_form.php, which implies back-end work, I gained insight into structuring forms with HTML.

**Responsive Design Techniques:** I learned how to design the webpage to be responsive, ensuring that it adapts well to both large and small screens. Using media queries and flexible layouts in CSS allowed me to better understand mobile-first design principles.

**Designing with Figma:** As someone who uses Figma, I was able to translate my Figma designs into HTML and CSS code. This reinforced my understanding of design systems, layout techniques, and visual hierarchy.



## Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them

**Responsive Design Issues:** Initially, the layout didn't adjust well on mobile devices. The text in some sections was overflowing, and images weren't resizing as expected. To fix this, I focused on refining the CSS with media queries, adjusting the layout and typography for different screen sizes. This required a lot of testing and tweaking, but I eventually achieved a consistent look across devices.

**Form Functionality:** The contact form required proper setup to collect and process data. At first, the form wasnâ€™t working as expected, particularly the form submission. Although the back-end (contact_form.php) was not implemented in this project, I learned how to structure the form correctly and link it to a back-end script.

**Image Optimization:** The images used in the portfolio section were initially too large, which slowed down the page load time. To resolve this, I optimized the images by reducing their file sizes while maintaining quality, ensuring faster loading times without compromising visual appeal.

**CSS Specificity Issues:** While styling the page, I encountered problems with conflicting CSS styles, especially when multiple selectors applied to the same elements. I resolved this by ensuring that the CSS selectors were more specific and that I used proper class names to avoid overriding styles unintentionally.
